# Skin-Cancer-Detection
Implementing a multiclass classification model on a skin cancer dataset using a custom model in Tensorflow

### Objective:
Goal of this project is to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma

### Dataset:
Dataset is available at : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xLfSQUGDl8ezNNbUkpuHOYvSpTyxVhCs/view

### Understanding the Dataset:
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

The data set contains the following diseases:

-Actinic keratosisBasal cell carcinoma
-Dermatofibroma
-Melanoma
-Nevus
-Pigmented benign keratosis
-Seborrheic keratosis
-Squamous cell carcinoma
-Vascular lesion
